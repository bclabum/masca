# Using Masca

## How to start using Masca?

Masca currently works only on **MetaMask Flask**. You can find it [here](https://metamask.io/flask/). Snaps are expected to be supported in the production MetaMask sometime in the second half of 2023. With that said, users will be able to connect to any dApp using Masca without any additional steps or software.

## Configuration dApp

We implemented an easy-to-use [dApp to configure Masca](https://masca.io) according to your needs and display your data. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/blockchain-lab-um/masca).

## Demo Platform

We have also created a simple [Solidity Course demo dApp](https://blockchain-lab-um.github.io/course-dapp/) where you can receive your first VC and start building your decentralized identity!
